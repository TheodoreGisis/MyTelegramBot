# MyTelegramBot


## Description 
In this project, our goal is to create from scratch a Telegram bot that returns stock markter prices and  useful information about the weather of some cities. Our bot is returning proper data for two Greek cities, Thessaloniki and Athens. Let's get deep on what is this data! First, bot is printing the temperature in Celsius for the city that you choose. The second data is the feel temperature, also in Celsius and the third is one little description of what is the weather (cloudy, rainy etc.)
